# Hello 👋

##### I’m an Economist (M.Sc. at UFMG) and I’ve been working with data for 5+ years — somewhere along the way I fell into healthcare, public policy, real estate, and social research, and honestly… I kind of love the organized chaos of it all. Right now, I’m a Data Analyst at Einstein Hospital Israelita , working on Proadi-SUS projects and using econometrics and statistics to turn real-world questions into clear, evidence-based answers (and hopefully better decisions). I’m the type who enjoys cleaning messy datasets, building reproducible analyses, and turning results into dashboards people can actually use.
